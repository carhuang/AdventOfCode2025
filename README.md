# Advent Of Code 2025

My Python solution to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). The Advent of Code is a series of Christmas-themed coding puzzles released every year in December. My solutions are tested on Python 3.10.12.

### Dependencies
I use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage my Python packages. I try to refrain from using third-party libraries whenever possible, but there are some days where I find it better to use them. Here is a list of all days when I *do* use third-party libraries -- Day 5.

### How to Run My Code
1. Go to the directory that contains the solution to the specific day #.
```bash
cd 03
```
2. Run code with `uv`. Make sure you have `uv` installed.
```bash
uv run 3.py
```
